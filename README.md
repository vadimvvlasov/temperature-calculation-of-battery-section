# temperature-calculation-of-battery-section
## super-simple analytical model of convective heat transfer for calculating the temperature on the surface of a cylindrical body

Using the experimental data, we calculate the coefficient of convective heat transfer by the formula:

q_{cт} = a*(Т_0—Т_{ст}), (1)

Next, for a body with arbitrary dimensions, we calculate the temperature head in the reverse order

(Т_0—Т_{ст}) = q_{cт} / a, (2)
